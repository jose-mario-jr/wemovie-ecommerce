# Wemovie E-commerce submodule for WeFit

Live demo: https://wemovie-ecommerce.vercel.app/

## Next steps:

I here include some next steps that I would take to improve the project:

- Convert more components to styled-components;
- Improve the styled-components usage to have more reusable components;
- Add some kind of state management;
- Improve the cart object to be more complex and have more information instead of a reference to the loaded movies;

Since it all would take too much time, I'll submit the project as it is now, in an attempt to show that although the project is working, we can always improve it, but it would take more time.
